# scalaLangTests
Code snippets created while learning Scala language

This repository contains tests that were inspired by the Programming in Scala book.

Most of the material discussed in subsequent chapters of the book is covered with simplified test. This is however, in no way, an excessive approach to test Scala language implementation. The only purpose of this repository is to turn the teory into practice, and to, hopefully, have a starting point for future reference.

Work in progress.
